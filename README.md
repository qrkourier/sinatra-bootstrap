# Stack Exchange Equivalent Domains

## What's it?
Consume the feed that describes all of the web sites in the Stack Exchage
network and prints a comma-separated list of unique publicly registered domain
names.

## Why does this exist?
I made this to practice building a simple web app with Ruby (off Rails) and as a proof of concept to help persuade LastPass to default to treating these domains as equivalent for purposes of suggesting the appropriate credential when at the form-based login page of any of them.
